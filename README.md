# Romberg Integration

A repository holding an implementation of the
[Romberg integration formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romberg's_method),
written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly. You can use the algorithm on the
[website](dzfrias.github.io/romberg/), or view the [source code](./src) in this
repository.

We have also written a [paper](./paper.pdf) proving Romberg's method and
explaining some of the code.
